This is a small demo
====================

The core is a basic raytracer engine in a fragment shader (GLSL).
It is able to play a music and animate scenes on it.
For now it handles only spheres as objects, and multi-directional lights.
The camera is movable too.

dependencies
------------

* SFML (include in the project, see below)
* OpenGL with GLSL >= 1.30 supported


instructions
------------

  $ make
  $ ./demo

if you don't have installed SFML, you should run

  $ make run

instead of

  $ ./demo


how to use it
-------------

Look at the code in main.cpp.
You must set the correct BPM for the song you want to play with (ogg vorbis
format).
